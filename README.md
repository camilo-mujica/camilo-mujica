<h1 align="center">👋 Hi there! I'm Camilo.</h1>
<h3 align="center">A Frontend Developer Focused on Creating Engaging User Experiences 🎨💻</h3>

I'm a Frontend Developer with nearly 6 years of experience, specializing in **React**, **Next.js**, and **TypeScript**. I am passionate about building efficient, responsive, and accessible user interfaces that provide excellent user experiences. My focus is on translating complex business requirements into functional and visually appealing products.

I have solid experience working with **Redux**, **GraphQL**, **TailwindCSS**, **Sass**, and **Bootstrap**, as well as strong knowledge of **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and of course **TypeScript**. I also enjoy exploring **AWS** services like **Route 53**, **S3**, **Amplify**, and **Cloudfront** to deploy and optimize frontend solutions.

In my side projects, I experiment with **React Native** and **Angular**, expanding my knowledge of mobile development and different frontend frameworks. I’m constantly learning new tools and patterns, staying up-to-date with the latest trends in frontend technologies.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat about frontend development or collaborate on exciting projects!
